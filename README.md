# Invasión Star Wars

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Novak-Fenocchio/Invasion-Star-Wars.git`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`! :D

## Notes

- I used the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/api/people/) to get the data.
- I used bloc & cubits to manage the state of the app. But I would be able to use Provider, or simple setState
- I did some organization things useless for a small project, but it were for demostrate my skills.
- There are some things missed like .env but that I think that are not necessary for this demo project.
- I would be able to use hive to persist the reported characters but I haven't time to do it for my current job :(
